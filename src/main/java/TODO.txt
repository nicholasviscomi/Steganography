BUGS (commit after each fix):
[ ] When the image is created from the bytes retrieved from
    the EncodedImage, it does not work. When the image is created
    from encodedContents, it works fine
        Makes me assume that the error happens
            (a) during the imgFromBytes function
            (b) reading the bytes from Encoded image
            (c) somewhere else I cannot yet see
[x] The correct message and image are only created if the new directory DOES NOT exist already
[ ] Beautify this ugly code
[ ] Can only encode message to 1 LSB; Function doesn't allow anything > 1



[x] Get bmp image bytes
[x] Convert bytes to binary strings
[x] Make function that displays bmp image from byte[] (start at byte 54!!!!!!)

[x] Encode message into 2 LSB
[x] Save encoded image into .bmp file
[x] Try making an all black/white image by make all bytes 11111111/00000000
[x] Make sure you know how each manipulation actually works
[x] Decode the message from a .bmp file
[ ] Display image from 1 LSB
    --> Set the bits per pixel to 1 in the bitmap header
    --> Look at the headers of the 8-bit and 1-bit images
